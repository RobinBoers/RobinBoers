### Hi there 👋

I'm a random teenager from the Netherlands, who enjoys building software for fun.
I'm 16[^1] years old and I currently work at Qdentity. I enjoy building websites and
apps in my free time, and I love to play around with Linux.

Nowaways, this account mostly mirrors repos from [my own git server](http://git.dupunkto.org/~robin).
I also have a [Codeberg profile](https://codeberg.org/RobinBoers).

🏠 [geheimesite.nl](http://geheimesite.nl)  
🌱 I'm currently [developing a language](https://git.geheimesite.nl/grape-lang) :)
