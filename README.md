Hi, Iâ€™m Robin (he/him), also known as **axcelott** online. I'm a random teenager from the Netherlands. I build open-source things related to the Web and Linux (or BSD), which I, uhm... rant about on my [personal website](https://geheimesite.nl). I'm also member of a little *whatever* called [{du}punkto](https://dupunkto.org). 

Currently, I'm:

ðŸŒ± Trying to [develop a language](https://git.dupunkto.org/axcelott/signo) (still a WorkInProgressâ„¢)  
ðŸ”¥ Working on [the best CMS in the multiverse](https://git.dupunkto.org/axcelott/pebble).

<!-- ðŸ”¥ Working on an [easier](https://gilest.org/indie-easy.html) [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) [publishing platform](https://git.dupunkto.org/dupunkto/untitled). -->

This GitHub account mostly mirrors repos from [Gitz](https://git.dupunkto.org)&mdash; my own Git frontend, hosted over at {du}punkto. I also mirror them to my [Codeberg profile](https://codeberg.org/RobinBoers).
 
You can reach me via email. I love a good conversation, so donâ€™t hesitate to shoot me an email, Iâ€™ll always reply.
